BeaconTools - Universal beacon scanning
=======================================
|PyPI Package| |Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Requirements Status|

A Python library for working with various types of Bluetooth LE Beacons.

Currently supported types are:

* `Eddystone Beacons <https://github.com/google/eddystone/>`__
* `iBeacons <https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/>`__ (Apple and Cypress CYALKIT-E02)
* `Estimote Beacons (Telemetry and Nearable) <https://github.com/estimote/estimote-specs>`__
* Control-J Monitor (temp/humidity/light)
* `COVID-19 Exposure Notifications <https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing>`__

The BeaconTools library has two main components:

* a parser to extract information from raw binary beacon advertisements
* a scanner which scans for Bluetoth LE advertisements using bluez and can be configured to look only for specific beacons or packet types

Installation
------------
If you only want to use the **parser** install the library using pip and you're good to go:

.. code:: bash

    pip install beacontools
    
If you want to perfom beacon **scanning** there are a few more requirements.
First of all, you need a supported OS: currently that's Linux with BlueZ, and FreeBSD.
Second, you need raw socket access (via Linux capabilities, or by running as root).

A typical Linux installation would look like this:

.. code:: bash

    # install libbluetooth headers and libpcap2
    sudo apt-get install python-dev libbluetooth-dev libcap2-bin
    # grant the python executable permission to access raw socket data
    sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' $(readlink -f $(which python))
    # install beacontools with scanning support
    pip install beacontools[scan]
    
Usage
-----
See the `examples <https://github.com/citruz/beacontools/tree/master/examples>`__ directory for more usage examples.

Parser
~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from beacontools import parse_packet
    
    tlm_packet = b"\x02\x01\x06\x03\x03\xaa\xfe\x11\x16\xaa\xfe\x20\x00\x0b\x18\x13\x00\x00\x00" \
                 b"\x14\x67\x00\x00\x2a\xc4\xe4"
    tlm_frame = parse_packet(tlm_packet)
    print("Voltage: %d mV" % tlm_frame.voltage)
    print("Temperature: %d Â°C" % tlm_frame.temperature)
    print("Advertising count: %d" % tlm_frame.advertising_count)
    print("Seconds since boot: %d" % tlm_frame.seconds_since_boot)

Scanner
~~~~~~~
.. code:: python

    import time

    from beacontools import BeaconScanner, EddystoneTLMFrame, EddystoneFilter

    def callback(bt_addr, rssi, packet, additional_info):
        print("<%s, %d> %s %s" % (bt_addr, rssi, packet, additional_info))

    # scan for all TLM frames of beacons in the namespace "12345678901234678901"
    scanner = BeaconScanner(callback,
        # remove the following line to see packets from all beacons
        device_filter=EddystoneFilter(namespace="12345678901234678901"),
        packet_filter=EddystoneTLMFrame
    )
    scanner.start()
    time.sleep(10)
    scanner.stop()



.. code:: python

    import time
    from beacontools import BeaconScanner, IBeaconFilter

    def callback(bt_addr, rssi, packet, additional_info):
        print("<%s, %d> %s %s" % (bt_addr, rssi, packet, additional_info))

    # scan for all iBeacon advertisements from beacons with the specified uuid 
    scanner = BeaconScanner(callback, 
        device_filter=IBeaconFilter(uuid="e5b9e3a6-27e2-4c36-a257-7698da5fc140")
    )
    scanner.start()
    time.sleep(5)
    scanner.stop()

    # scan for all iBeacon advertisements regardless from which beacon
    scanner = BeaconScanner(callback,
        packet_filter=IBeaconAdvertisement
    )
    scanner.start()
    time.sleep(5)
    scanner.stop()


Customizing Scanning Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some Bluetooth dongle don't allow scanning in Randomized MAC mode. If you don't receive any scan results, try setting the scan mode to PUBLIC:

.. code:: python

    from beacontools import BeaconScanner, BluetoothAddressType

    scanner = BeaconScanner(
        callback,
        scan_parameters={"address_type": BluetoothAddressType.PUBLIC}
    )

For all available options see ``Monitor.set_scan_parameters``.
